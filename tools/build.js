/* ---- build.js — turns the templates into plain HTML files -----------------
   Run with `npm run build`. Reads the page list, renders each through the
   shared shell in templates/page.js, and writes finished HTML to disk.

   This is a build step, not a framework. It runs on Ben's machine and its
   output is ordinary static files that Cloudflare Pages serves directly — no
   server, no runtime, nothing for the visitor's browser to execute before the
   page appears. The only thing it buys is that the <head>, the nav and the
   footer exist once in source instead of being copy-pasted into every page and
   drifting apart.

   The checks at the end are the point of doing it this way at all. A human
   cannot reliably keep nine titles unique and under sixty characters; a script
   checks it every single run and refuses to let a duplicate through. */
